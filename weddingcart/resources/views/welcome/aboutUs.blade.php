        <p>The idea to launch WeddinCart came in Early April of 2013 when three brothers were talking about an upcoming marriage in the family and selecting the gift for a young couple who were getting married in one of the city that was a top IT hub in the country. After a few ideas in mind it was evident that the gifts that we are choosing might not be a real help to a young couple starting a family. More importantly that they were in a new city away from their parents and taking up a rented apartment that they will have to set up as a priority. </p>
        <p> While recalling our own experiences with wedding gifts, we remembered the numerous crystal vases, LaOpala crockery sets , dinner sets, juicer, blankets, etc that we had discarded before leaving our homes to set up our new family. So we decided to create a platform where we solve the most important problem for a newly married couple â€“ Setting up the new house. We wanted them to concentrate on their marriage and let the guests and family members finance their home with essentials.</p>
        <p> WeddinCart.com is a platform where as a young couple you can invite your guests to your wedding, share venue details, get confirmations, share your wedding wish list and request to financing it. Our focus is not to connect with a gift store and get you in to the same situation but only concentrate on the big expenditures, TV, Fridge, Sofa set, Etc.</p>
